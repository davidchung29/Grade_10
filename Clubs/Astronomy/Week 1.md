# Intro to Stellar Evolution and Classification

### Life of a Star
1. Born in dense molecular clouds
    - as the cloud collapses, it breaks off into smaller regions forming stellar cores, which is the hot center of a star.  
    - The protostars rotate faster and increase in temperature as they condense, and are surrounded by a protoplanetary disk which may later form planets.
2. The center of the contracting protostar gets hotter and nuclear reactions begin. 
    - Hydrogen is converted into helium in the core and is born onto the main sequence. 
    - The star continues to burn hydrogen and helium for the rest of its life and will remain a main sequence star. 
3. When the hydrogen in the core has all been burned to helium, energy stops generating and the core begins to contract
    - The internal temperature of the star increases and and ignites a shell of hydrogen burning around the inert core. This results in an increased energy generation rate and ultimately causes the star to expand enormousely and increase its luminosity. 
    - The star is now a red giant
4. The core gets even hotter and sarts to burn helium into carbon. 
    - If the mass of the star is less than 2.2 solar masses the core ignites in a helium core flash. 
    - If its heavier than 2.2 solar masses, the ignition is more gentle, and the star continues to burn hydrogen. 
5. The helium is converted into carbon much faster than burning the hydrogen. 
    - Once all the helium is converted, the inert carbon core contracts and increases in temperature. This ignites a helium burning shell just above the core, which is then surrounded by a hydrogen burning shell. 

### Spectral Classifications

| Class | Temperature     | Star Colour                         | Mass | Radius | Luminosity |
|-------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+------+--------+------------|
| O     | 30,000-60,000 K | Blue ("blue")                       | 60   | 15     | 1,400,000  |
| B     | 10,000-30,000 K | Bluish-white ("blue-white")         | 18   | 7      | 20,0000    |
| A     | 7,500-10,000 K  | White thats slightly blue ("white") | 3.2  | 2.5    | 80         |
| F     | 6,000-7,500 K   | White ("yellow-white")              | 1.7  | 1.3    | 6          |
| G     | 5,000-6,000 K   | Light yellow ("yellow")             | 1.1  | 1.1    | 1.2        |
| K     | 3,500-5,000 K   | Light orange ("orange")             | 0.8  | 0.9    | 0.4        |
| M     | 2,000-3,500 K   | 

### Blackbody Radiation
- emits electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths. 
- sun is an example 
- The blackbody spectrum does not depend on the material but only on the temperature.
- as temperature increases, the wavelength with maximum intensity shifts left
	- the maximum moves to the visible spectrum at around 4000 K
	- this is why hot metal, like ovens glow

### H-R Diagram
- Theoretical HR diagram
	- plots the temperature of star compatred to their luminosity
- Observational HR diagram 
	- plots the colour of stars against their absolute magnitude
- Depending on its initial mass, stars go through different stages, with each stage having a specific temperature and luminosity. 
- By finding a star's position in the diagram, astronomers can know about its internal structure and evolutionary stage.

1. main sequence
	- stars spend 90% of their lives here by burning hydrogen into helium 
2. Redgiant and supergiant 
	- low surface temperatuere and high luminosities 
3. Whitedwarf stars 
	- very hot with low luminosities because of their size


### Definitions
Molecular Clouds
: a type of cold and dark interstellar cloud composed of dust and gas in the form of hydrogen molecules. 

Protoplanetary disk 
: a rotating disk of dense gas surrounding a young new star. If its big enough, it can start the formation of planetary embryos

Planetary Embryos
: moon-like stuff

Planet
: A celestial body that orbits a sun, is big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape, and must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other object objects of a similar size near its orbit around the sun. 

Protostar
:A contracting mass of gas that represents an early stage in the formation of a star. 

Nucleosynthesis 
:The creation of new atomic nuclei.

Red Giant
:A very large star with high luminosity and low surface temperature

Blackbody Radiation
: a theoretical body that is a "perfect" absorber and a "perfect" emitter for radiations of all wavelengths.

Luminosity 
: the intrinsic brightness of a celestial object
