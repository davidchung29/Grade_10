## Keplers law

1. Planets move in elipses with the sun at one focus
2. Equal mas are swept out by the radius vector at equal times
3. The ratio a^3/T^2 is the same for all planets where a is the major axis, and T is the period.

## Hubble's law
v = HD
v = Velocity
H = Hubble's law
D = distance

f = 1 + \frac{\Delta v}{c}f_0
