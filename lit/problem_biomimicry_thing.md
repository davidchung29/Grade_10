[WHO Air pollution](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1) |- kills over 7 million people every year<br/> -low to mid income countries suffer the most<br/> -9 out of 10 people breathe air over the WHO guideline limits<br/> - Air pollution is a major threat to our health and the climate | The harmful effects of air pollution, most specifically on people. 
[NAT GEO Air pollution](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/air-pollution/) | Air pollution can be in the form of gas, solid particles, or liquid droplets, and are most commonly found in large cities. For people, air pollution can leave both short-term and long-term effects. These include irritations, pneumonia, bronchitis, nausea, heart disease, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, damages to the nerves, brains, as well as other organs, and can also lead to birth defects. Air pollution also damages entire ecosystsems through the presence of haze which obscures the vision and muffles sounds. It also damages the water and soil, and can cause acid rain. Air pollution also plays a large factor in global warming by adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. In order to reduce and regulate air pollution, certain contries have created limits on pollution. People can also take the necessary efforts to reduce air pollution. | Air pollution can effect both the health of different persons as well as the world through different forms. People can help in solving this issue by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases they help contribute to the air. 
[Medicine Plus](https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html) | - mixture of solid and gas particles in the air <br /> -caused from car emissions, chemicals from factories, pollen and mold spores, as well as from dust.<br \> can cause health problems that are related to the heart and lung, especially to older and younger people.| Medicine Plus explains that Air pollution is a mixture of different substances in the air that is mainly caused through pollution from cars or factories that can also seriously harm some people's health. 
[BBC NEWS](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58657224) | -low and middle income countries suffer the most, since they heavily rely on fossil fuels for economic development <br /> - As time goes on, people are becoming more lenient with the limits on safe amounts of pollution <br /> - it is very hard to stop tiny particles from pollution being breathed into the lungs. <br /> - is linked to heart disease and strokes, and for children, can reduce lung growth and cause aggravated asthma | Air pollution is becoming more and more dangerous, and people are allowing it to be that way by constantly lowering the limits on what's considered "a safe amount of pollution"\
[European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-pollution-sources-1) | - Air pollutant can be released directly into the atmosphere, or can form as a "result of chemical interaction involving precursor substances" <br /> -burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes and solvent use(manufacturing and factory stuff), agriculture, waste management, as well as natural sources(like volcanic eruptions and emissions from some plants), all contribute to air pollution. | This source provides a nice list of common air pollutants, and also briefly explains what air pollution is.
