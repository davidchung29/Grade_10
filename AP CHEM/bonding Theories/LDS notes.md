## Lewis Dot Structure
### 10.11
- When drawing the Lewis dot diagram for a covalent molecule, we utilize the valence bond theory, which is known as the localized electron theory
- The localized electron theory, or valence bond theory assumes that all bonds are localized bonds formed between two atoms by the donation of an electron from each atom
- The two atoms bond by overlapping orbitals. 
- **Coordinate covalent bonds** - both electrons for the bond come from only one of the atoms

### Drawing a Lewis dot structure
1. The central atom is the least electronegative atom 
2. Surround the central atom with remaining atoms
3. count the total number of valence electrons in the entire molecule
4. draw single bonds to bond the central atom to outside atoms
5. Subract two electrons for asdf;lkjasdf;j;lkjasdfasdfj;lkj;lkj;lkjsadf;lkjdfs;lkjasdf;lkjasdf;lkjasdfeach bond drawn
6. Any remaining electrons should be placed on the central atom. 
7. Check if every atom meets the octet rule 
8. Formal check 
    - strategy to see if a molecule is real or not. 
    - charges in a formal charge are imaginary
    1. negative formal charge goes on more electronegative and positive formal chage goes on less electronegative atoms. Objective is for the formal chage to have a total of 0. 
    2. Formal Charge = normmal electrons - valence electrons in molecule 
    3. look for expanded octets.

## Bonding Theories
### 10.12.2021

- Valence Bond theory 
    1. Lewis dot structures
        - Lewis dot diagrams are <mark>typically used for covalent molecules </mark>since Ionic compounds usually form cubic solids 
        - A Lewis dot structure <mark>does not show anything about the shape or geometry of the molecule, instead it only shows the arrangement of valence electrons.</mark>
    2. VSEPR theory <br />&rarr; predicts the electron geometry and molecular geometry of a molecule. 
        - **VSEPR stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion**
        - The VSEPR theory assumes that each atom achieves a <mark>geometry that minimizes the repulsion between valence electrons</mark> of that atom and the valence eloectrons of all nearby atoms!<br />

        Electron Geo | Molecular Geo
        --- | ---
        geometry of electrons | geometry of molecules
        shows lone pairs | hides lone pairs
        
        Non-Polar Covalent | Polar Covalent | Ionic
        --- | --- | ---
        $0.0$ | $0.0-1.7$ | $1.7+$

        - <mark>Dipole moments point to the atom with a higher electronegativity</mark>
        - assign slight charge 
        - The molecular structure can change the charge of an atom
        - Molecular geomtries that are <mark>symmetrical will cancel out the charge on the atoms. </mark>
        - If a <mark>molecule is not symmetrical, it has a permanent dipole moment, or polar molecular polarity, and has a permanent slight charge.</mark> 
        - The molecular geometry is different from the electron geometry when there are lone pairs. This is because the molecular geometry does not look at lone pairs while electron geometry does. 
        - to determine if a molecule is polar
            1. If it is symmetrical it is nonpolar
            2. If not all of the attachments are the same it would be polar 

    3. Hybridization theory <br />&rarr; describes the type  of atomic obitals used by atoms to share electrons
