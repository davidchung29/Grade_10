## Intramolecular Forces
- known as chemical bonds
- occurs *inside* of a substance, and is stronger than intermolecular forces or physical bonds
- Three types 
	- ionic/electrostatic
		- Metal + Nonmetal
		- > 1.7
		- Occurs when there is a transfer of electrons
		- LDS Ionic
			1. Neutral LDS
			2. Arrows (transfer)
			3. Bracket and Charge
		- Results in two completely charged atoms or ions
		- Incredibly Strong Chemical bonds
		- Crystalline solid at room temperature
	- covalent/molecular
		- Nonmetal + Nonmetal 
		- polar 
			- 0-1.7
			- Polar covalent weakly conducts electricity and dissolves in water because they have a slight charge
			- uneven sharing of electons
			- Things with slight charges dissolve easily in water. 
			- An arrow shows the dipole, or the direction of the uneven sharing of electrons 
			- liquid at room temperature

		- nonpolar 
			- 0
			- No dipole Moment 
			- even sharing of electrons 
			- Only diatomic elements will be considered by AP H_2, O_2, F_2, ...
			- even if the bonds are polar, the shape can cancel out the slight charge.
			- usually gas
			- does not dissolve in water or conduct electricity
		- sharing of electrons 
		- very weak bonds 

	- metallic
		- Metal + Metal
		- mostly gases at room temperature 
		- can be liquids or solids at room temperature
		- conducts electricity

## Coloumb's Law 
$$E = \frac{kQ_1Q_2}{R^2}$$ 
$$K = \frac{9.00\times 10^9 J \times m}{C^2}$$
- A negative potential energy means an attraction is stable
- A positive potential energy means an attraction is unstable
- If two atoms of oppositte charge are brought close together, they attract well and have low potential energy
- If two atoms of like charge are brought close together, they repel and have high potential energy
