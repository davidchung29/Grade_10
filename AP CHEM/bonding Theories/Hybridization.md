- Aufbac's Principle
	- start from lowest hybridization
- Hund's Principle 
	- one arrow goes up, other goes down
- The dumbells are where there is a high probability of electrons to be in. 
- Central atoms hybridize, or blend and mix their atomic orbitals before bonding
- P orbitals
	- P orbitals do not give very good overlap when bonding with nearby atoms.
	- unhybridized p orbitals need to form the second bond or double bond with the central atom. 

- By hybridizing, the orbitals with s orbitals have better surface area for bonding with nearby atoms
- The number of orbitals an atom needs is the number of orbitals it must hybridize, and that will equal the number of orbitals the atom will make
- if an atom needs four orbitals, it must hybridize with four orbitals  
- atoms overlap their orbitals with nearby orbitals of other atoms in order to share electrons. 
- Lone pairs of electrons go into a hybridized orbitals
- **Localized Electron Theory "localizes" the electrons, assuming that they are static, causing it to be less accurate than the molecular theory**
- π bond &rarr; 2nd - 3rd bond
- ∑ bond &rarr; 1st bond
