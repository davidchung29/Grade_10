Investment: giving up something in the present in order to gain something more in the future.

#### Asset Classes
Asset classes are a type of financial instrument where an individual can put their money. The three main asset classes are *stocks, bonds,* and *real estate.*
#### Inflation 
Inflation is the measure of change in the general level of the prices of things in an economy over time. For example, in 1985, a cup of coffee might have been $0.25, but now it may be $1.25. If the interest rate a bank offers does not rise as quickly as the inflation rate, the money in that was put into that bank would be worth less over time. 
#### Risk 
There are no gurantees in investing meaning that investments always come with a risk.
