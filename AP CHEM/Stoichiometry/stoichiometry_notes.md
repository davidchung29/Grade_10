In order to find the percent of an element ina compound by mass, $\frac{\text{element}}{\text{molar mass of compound }}.$

- The Empirical Formula is the lowest whole number ratio formula
- To find the Molecular Formula, find the current mass of the compound, then divide the molar mass by the current mass. Multiply the amounf of each element in the compound by this value.
