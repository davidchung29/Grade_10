### Purpose
To determine the percentage and molarity of $H_2O_2$ in ordinary over-the-counter solutions of hydrogen peroxide by tritating a solution of $0.02$ $M$ $KMnO_4$ into a measured amount of an unknown concentration of hydrogen peroxide, $H_2O_2.$

### Lab Variables
Independant - solution of $0.02$ $M$ $KMnO_4$
Dependent - concentration of $H_2O_2$

### Lab Safety Considerations
$H_2O_2$&rarr; can cause fire, permanent eye damage, eye and skin irritation or burns, severe digestive tract irritation , and blood abnormalities<br />
$KMnO_4$&rarr; can cause fire, severe eye and skin irritation or burns, can cause respiratory tract irritation and possible burns, and severe digestive tract irritation and possible burns<br />
$H_2SO_4$&rarr; causes eye and skin burns, digestive and respiratory tract burns, may be fatal if mist is inhaled, can cause cancer, reacts violently with water and other substances. May cause lung damage, absorbs moisture from air, and corrosive to metal.<br />
$H_2O$&rarr; non-hazardous

### Materials
- 1 burrets
- Erlenmeyer flasks
- Stir plate
- Magnetic stir bar or self stir
- Balance
- Household hydrogen peroxide 
- $0.02M$ potassium permanganate solution
- $3.0M$ sulfuric acid
- $0.1M$ manganese(II) sulfate
- Distilled water

### Procedures
1. Obtain and wear goggles.
2. Rinse and fill a buret with standardized $KMnO_4$ solution. Record the molarity
of thesolution.
3. Determine the mass of a clean, dry Erlenmeyer flask to the correct
number ofsignificant figures, and record.
4. From the buret on the front table, record the initial volume (again, to the
correct number of significant figures). Add approximately $1.5 mL$ of
ordinary household hydrogen peroxide. Record the final buret volume.
5. Find the mass of the flask with the peroxide and record.
6. Add about $35 mL$ of distilled water, $5 mL$ of $3.0$ $M$ $H2SO_4$, and $3$ or $4$ drops of
0.1 MMnSO4, which acts as a catalyst.
7. Record the volume in your $KMnO_4$ buret, and titrate your sample to a pale pink end point
8. Calculate the percentage of $H_2O_2$ in the original sample
9. Repeat titration if possibleat least tw to three times for consistent results. 

### Pre-lab Questions

### Data Analysis / Calculations
1.  $$0.01451\text{L} \times \frac{0.02\text{ mol MnO}_4^{-}}{1 \text{ L MnO}_4^{-}} = \boxed{2.90\times10^{-4}\text{ mol MnO}_4^{-}} \\ 0.0146\text{L} \times \frac{0.02\text{ mol MnO}_4^{-}}{1 \text{ L MnO}_4^{-}} = \boxed{2.92\times10^{-4}\text{ mol MnO}_4^{-}}$$

2. $$2.90\times10^{-4}\text{ mol MnO}_4^{-} \times \frac{5\text{ mol }}{2 \text{ mol}}=\boxed{7.25\times 10^{-4}\text{ mol H}_2\text{O}_2} \newline 2.92\times10^{-4}\text{ mol MnO}_4^{-} \times \frac{5\text{ mol }}{2 \text{ mol}}=\boxed{7.30\times 10^{-4}\text{ mol H}_2\text{O}_2}$$

3. $$\frac{7.25\times 10^{-4} \times 34.017 = 2.47 \times \cancel{10^{-2}g}}{2.47\times 10^{-2}g + (158.034 \times 2.90 \times{10^{-4}}g)= 7.05 \times \cancel{10^{-2}}}\times 100 = \boxed{35.04} \newline \frac{7.30\times 10^{-4} \times 34.017 = 2.48 \times \cancel{10^{-2}}g}{2.48 \times 10^{-2}g + (158.034 \times 2.92 \times{10^{-4}})g = 7.09 \times \cancel{10^{-2}}}\times100 = \boxed{34.98}$$
4. $$\frac{2}{2+5 = 7}\times 100 = \boxed{28.57}$$

5. $$ \frac{|0.3-0.3504|}{0.3} \times 100 = \boxed{16.80} \newline \frac{|0.3-0.3498|}{0.3} \times 100 = \boxed{16.60}$$

### Discussion
1. Oxidation is losing electrons while reduction is gaining the electrons lost from the oxidation
2. 
    - No change, since cleaning with water does not change the hydrogen perxide in a solution
    - too low, since there might be other substances from previous uses in the buret or reservoir. 

3. The labeling of household hydrogen peroxide is pretty accurate since it had an average percent error of $16.70$ percent
4. 
    - $2:5$
    - $2.780 \times 10^-{4}$ moles
    - $6.95 \times 10^{-4}$
    - $2.78 \times 10^{-2}$ M
    - $\frac{0.0439\text{g}}{25\text{g}} = \boxed{0.176}$

## Post Lab

### Purpose
To determine the percentage and molarity of $H_2O_2$ in ordinary over-the-counter solutions of hydrogen peroxide by tritating a solution of $0.02$ $M$ $KMnO_4$ into a measured amount of an unknown concentration of hydrogen peroxide, $H_2O_2.$

### Abstract

This lab examined the concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide by titrating a solution of $0.02 \text{M KMnO}_4.$ In order to find the concentraion of hydrogen peroxide, we titrated $\text{M KMnO}_4$ until the solution turned a pale pink. Then we measured the amoung of $\text{M KMnO}_4$ used to find the molar concentration of the hydrogen peroxide. Our results showed that the molard concentraion of the hydrogen peroxide was an average of $0.29M,$ close to the $0.3M$ actual value. The results show that the claimed molar concentration of over-the-counter hydrogen peroxide is fairly accurate.
